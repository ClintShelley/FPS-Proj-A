# FPS Proj A
My 2nd deep dive into making a FPS game in unity C# from scratch
Starting 1/13/23
This game and development is based on FPS games that I enjoy(ed) and the things I'd like to see added to those games in the looter shooter genre all created by me with no assets store assets.
The theme is a dark and gloomy low poly fps looter shooter, which is heavily aim focused, munitions are scarce, and getting new guns and items is the central game loop
This project is a solo passion project and is being developed while working a full time job, (hopefully the time frames don't look too terrible)
